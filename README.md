**Project Description**
This project was the second JavaScript project completed in _The Odin Project_'s Foundations course. The first Javascript project was also a rock paper scissors game played in the browser console. This project is meant to practice using JavaScript to make functional buttons and to practice creating logic for score keeping. This project familiarized me with the branching process in Git and I began to really understand the way a Git can be used for workflow.

**Reflection**
JavaScript has been challenging for me, through the whole process. This project in particular, created struggle for me when I needed to change the screen to only show the results (and it's still not wuite how I would like it). This project made me comfortable with the syntax of JavaScript and how to invoke functions for browser use. I unfortunately had a lot of issues with Git at the very end of this project and ended up having to move my files to a new repo. That was very frustrating and disappointing, as I felt like I was getting the hang of using the Linux command line for my Git workflow. In doing this, I also lost the code for my initial rock paper scissors game (played in console).

**Future Upgrades**
I plan to recreate the console-playable rock paper scissors game for my portfolio. Originally, it was very plain and gave no indication that the console needed to be opened, so I think I will use HTMl and CSS to create an attractive home screen that has a button to open to console and directions (for the normies). As for the game with the UI, I plan to use HTML and CSS to add multiple themed pages for the user to choose from (I.E.: Alice in Wonderland, Shrek, Coachella, etc.), plus the normal responsive CSS stuff. The JavaScript needs a bit of an update including functionality of the reload button and creating more interesting load screens and win/lose screens.
